This context enables the user to insert a malicious payload into the <iframe> "src" attribute:

/* Do not forget to add authorization to the admin interface at [Insert into JS comment] */

In our example, we'll use the following payload to trigger the XSS:

*/ alert('XSS is successfully triggered!');/*

To trigger the XSS, an attacker needs to break out of comments. To break out of an HTML comment or a 
javascript multiline comment, a malicious script should be prepended with comment closing symbols (--> or */) and 
appended with comment opening symbols (<!-- or */). To break out of a single line javascript comments, next line 
symbols should be inserted.

To prevent XSS, avoid insertion of user-supplied input into HTML or Javascript comments.
