<li><span>[Insert between HTML tags]</span> Courses</li>

This context enables the user to insert a malicious payload between HTML tags:

In our example, we'll use the following payload to trigger the XSS:
<script>alert('XSS is successfully triggered!')</script>

To trigger the XSS by inserting arbitrary data into HTML tags, an attacker needs to get into a context where the inserted malicious script 
gets executed.

These contexts are javascript, style tag, or event handlers. HTML encoding (i.e. encoding all HTML reserved symbols into their benign 
representations) prevents an attacker from getting inside angle brackets <> or injecting arbitrary tags.

Each framework has its own function for HTML encoding. By default these functions may not encode some symbols leaving a possibility for the XSS,
thus they should be verified for sufficiency before being used.

With HTML encoding, the following substitutes are used for potentially malicious symbols:

& --> &amp;
< --> &lt;
> --> &gt;
" --> &quot;
' --> &#x27;
/ --> &#x2F;
